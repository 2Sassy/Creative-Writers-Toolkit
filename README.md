Creative Writers' Toolkit

Use artificial intelligence (GPT3) To help with the development of stories, screenplays and novels.
Stretching the creativity of AI to its limits...

I will add some youtube demos here soon.  For now:

This project is an attempt to explore the ways the latest AI technology can help creative writers and authors.
You'll need a GPT3 openai key to make this work, as well as some knowledge of how to get the code here running on your machine.
Even if you don't have that knowledge, please poke around here at some of the txt files in these folders
and wonder at the sheer power of the creative processes which have been unleashed by artificial intelligence.

Right here, now, you'll find Python files which will:

1- create and develop character outlines based on whatever inspiration you have

2- create story synopses based on those characters - or based on any other inspiration you want to give - i.e. 
            description of genres
            ideas for settings
            philosophical conjectures
            poetry
            news stories
            ...whatever.
 
 3- break those synopses down into scene outlines - and then break those scene outlines down even further to get more and more detailed story ideas.
 
 4- at any stage, you're working with text files, so you can break in and make changes, introducing your own ideas and edits to improve the story -THIS IS A VITAL PART OF THE PROCESS.  I'M NOT TRYING TO CREATE AN AUTOMATIC SYSTEM HERE. YOU ARE STILL THE WRITER.  YOU NEED TO DO SOME WORK!!
 
 5- finally, there's a file here which will turn your scene outlines into film scripts.  I kid you not. 
 
 NOTE: RESULTS DEPEND VERY MUCH ON THE QUALITY AND DETAIL OF YOUR SCENE OUTLINES.  GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT.  YOU'LL HAVE TO DO A LOT OF WORK TO TIDY UP AND IMPROVE YOUR SCENE OUTLINES TO GET A GOOD SCRIPT.
 
 
 
Does this technology mean that writers will be out of a job within a week, and that AI Shakespeares (or AI monkeys and typewriters) will be
turning out Hamlets to order for everyone who wants a story?

Short answer: I don't know.  But let's follow the rabbit hole and see how far it goes...

Please, comment and improve these tools..... and tell us what results you get.
