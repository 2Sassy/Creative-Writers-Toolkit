Uma is a transgender woman who is struggling to come to terms with her identity. She is shy and uncertain, but also confident and outgoing. She is searching for acceptance and understanding, both from others and herself. Uma was born in a small town in the Midwest, the youngest of three children. She grew up feeling different from her siblings and her peers, but she didn't understand why. After high school, she moved to the city to go to college. It was there that she met other people like her and began to explore her gender identity. She eventually came out as transgender and began living as her true self.
