Omni is a trans character who is constantly striving to find peace within themselves and others. They were born into a wealthy family but never quite fit in and were eventually disowned by their parents after coming out as trans. As a result, they have had to learn how to fend for themselves and have become quite independent. However, their emotional vulnerability and fear of abandonment often makes it difficult for them to trust people. Overall, Omni would be considered high in neuroticism, low in agreeableness, and high in openness to experience.
