Examples of neutral text rewritten in a paired down, hardboiled thriller style with direct, active language (1st person POV):

NEUTRAL PROSE: I got in the car and drove slowly through the seedy city at night. I was looking for someone, but didn't find them.

REWRITE:  I flipped the door, got in and turned the key.  I felt the engine turn over.  I checked the mirrors, pulled out.  It an electric dark.  Neon yellow from the streetlamps, neon blue and red from the shop windows.  I took it slow, searching the shadows and the silhouettes.  

There were plenty of people out, even at this time.  Most of them didn't want to be seen.  Not by me at any rate.  People turned away like the light from my headlights burned.  Junkies shrank back into doorways, prostitutes turned up their collars, somehow knowing my car had nothing in it for them.  Drunks with homes to go to and drunks without made themselves invisible against walls and behind parked cars.  I slowed down rolled the window down, peered out at faces.  No luck.
