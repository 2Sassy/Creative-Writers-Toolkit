NEUTRAL PROSE: I had picked up a truck load of canned tomatoes from a filthy warehouse in France early in the morning.  I was driving them to England.  The guys loading it had been slow, so now I was behind schedule.

REWRITE:  It had been a slow day all the way from the warehouse.  

The place had been a shithole. It had been dirty.  There was trash in the forecourt.  A pallet of cans had tipped, and burst.  Canned tomatoes take about four days to start to stink in a fridge.  In the sun in front of a French warehouse, they take much less.  I guessed these had been there a week or so, and they were right by my cab.

It had smelled bad even at seven am.  The guys loading my truck had been slow.  They were both big guys, one with a team t-shirt stretched tight over his belly, the other with arms like tree trunks.  They could have had the job done and me on my way in forty minutes.  

Instead, they threw the boxes onto the truck with barely a glance at what they were doing. I offered to help.  They just shrugged.  “Non,”  I wish I’d pushed it now.  I was way behind schedule.  They’d be pissed when I got back to England.  



NEUTRAL PROSE: I stopped at a store, bought some glue and a fire extinguisher.  I emptied the fire extinguisher somewhere nobody would see, then drove over it to damage it.  Then I put it into the back of the lorry, wedged between a crate and the door.

REWRITE:I saw the sign for a service station up ahead. It looked like the kind of place that would have an auto store. I pulled in, headed up the ramp. It did.  The store was small, but it had what I needed. I grabbed a fire extinguisher and some glue, and headed back to the truck.

The car park had a few trailers parked up, but I couldn't see anyone around. The fire extinguisher was a small one, designed for a cab or a car.  It was bright red, it stuck out.  Perfect. I took it behind the trailer, and pointed the black cone down into the ground behind a bush. I pulled the ring and aimed it into the bush. I squeezed the handle and the fire extinguisher let out a stream of white icy smoke.  It lasted a couple of minutes and then died.  I kept going until nothing was coming out. I checked around. Nobody there.  Nobody saw.

I waited for the gas to settle, then took the extinguisher behind my truck. I headed for the cab, climbed in, and backed the lorry over the extinguisher. I put the truck into gear, then drove back over it. I got out and inspected the damage. The metal was mangled and the plastic was cracked. Perfect. I opened the back doors, wedged the extinguisher between the door and the first pallet of tomatoes, slammed the door. 



NEUTRAL PROSE: The man was going to cut the seal.  I distracted his attention by asking him for a cigarette.

REWRITE:  The man got out a pair of pliers, moved to cut the seal.  I wanted him looking away.  My glue-job was a mess.

"Got a fag?" I said. 

"Eh?" he looked up at me, puzzled still holding the pliers. 

I shrugged at him, made a smoking gesture with my fingers.

"Non," he frowned, went back to the seal.



NEUTRAL PROSE: I attacked the two men.  I threw coffee at them, then we fought.  I got one of them down, and got kicked by the other.

REWRITE:I stood up fast, took two quick steps and closed the distance between us. I turned my body as I moved, throwing the coffee at head height in a big arc. The hot liquid caught bald guy square in the face. He reeled back, clutching at his eyes. Denim man saw the coffee coming and ducked under it. When he came up, he came up hard with a fist under my jaw. I saw it, and jerked my head back, but it still made grazing contact.  It was a hard fist, one that knew its job.

The world tilted. I tried to focus on the two men in front of me, but they were swimming in and out of my vision. I shook my head to clear it and took a step back. I was unsteady on my feet, but I had to keep moving. The two men charged me at the same time. I dodged to the side, twisted, and brought my elbow out, catching denim man in the stomach. He grunted and doubled over. I turned my attention to bald guy. He was coming at me with his hands curled into fists.  His biceps looked almost comically huge. I stood my ground and kicked him hard in the groin.  No need for anything flashy, and I didn’t want to get anywhere close to those fists.  He let out a high-pitched squeal and hit the ground.

Bald guy was on the floor. I didn't want him to get back up. But I didn’t have time to be certain.  Denim man was still on his feet, and he was ready for me now. 

I had to finish this quick. I charged at him. He was fast. He stepped sideways and kicked at my side. It felt like being kicked by a horse, but I've been kicked by horses before, and what you don't do is wait around to be kicked again.
