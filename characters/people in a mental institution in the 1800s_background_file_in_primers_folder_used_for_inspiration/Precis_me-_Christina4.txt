Christina is a kind, caring person who loves to help others. She is also shy and introverted, and tends to keep to herself. Torn between wanting to help others and wanting to be alone, Christina is a small, meek woman with long brown hair that she keeps pulled back in a messy bun. She has big brown eyes that dart around the room, never settling in one place for more than a few seconds. She is always fidgeting, tapping her fingers or toes or biting her nails.

Christina was born into a wealthy family, but she never knew her parents. She was raised by her aunt and uncle, who were very strict with her. When she was 18, she was sent to an asylum after she was caught trying to help one of the other patients escape.

Now known as "The Caregiver", Christina is always helping others, even if they don't want her help. She is also very gullible and tends to believe whatever people tell her. Although she is very compassionate and empathetic, Christina is also introverted, anxious, and easily overwhelmed.
