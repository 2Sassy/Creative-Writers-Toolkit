Nellie Bly is a tough, independent woman who will stop at nothing to get the story. She's incredibly driven and passionate, but also impulsive and quick to anger. She's a small woman with dark hair, piercing blue eyes, and a sharp, angular face. She speaks rapidly and clipped, her words dripping with sarcasm. Nellie was born into a poor family in Pennsylvania. She started working at a young age to help support her family. When she was older, she moved to New York City to start her career as a journalist. She quickly made a name for herself with her fearless reporting and investigative skills. Nellie is high in neuroticism, low in agreeableness, and high in openness, extraversion, and conscientiousness.
