The Beast is a savage, single-minded creature driven to kill and destroy. It is large and hulking, with black fur and glowing red eyes. The Beast is feared by mortals, as it is impulsive and quick to anger, lashing out without thinking about the consequences. The Beast was born from the blood of the demon lord Baal in the depths of Hell, and has been roaming the Earth ever since, feeding on the blood of innocent mortals.
