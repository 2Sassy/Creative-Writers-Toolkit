The femme fatale is a dangerous woman who uses her sexuality to manipulate and destroy men. Lady Penelope is the epitome of this archetype, using her charms to lure in her victims before brutally murdering them. She is a cold-blooded killer who takes pleasure in the suffering of others, and she will stop at nothing to get what she wants.
