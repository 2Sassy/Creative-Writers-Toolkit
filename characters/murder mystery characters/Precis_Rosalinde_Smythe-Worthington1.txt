Rosalinde Smythe-Worthington is a 25-year-old woman from a wealthy British family. She is attending her first season of balls after traveling for several years. Rosalinde is impulsive and sometimes reckless, but also intelligent and resourceful. She is torn between her role as dutiful daughter and society debutante, and her desire for adventure and excitement. Rosalinde has an air of mystery about her, and she is always impeccably dressed. She speaks with a slight accent, which is vaguely European.
