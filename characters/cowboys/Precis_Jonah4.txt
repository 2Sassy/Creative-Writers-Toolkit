Jonah is a cowboy who is struggling with inner demons. He is constantly at war with himself, trying to keep his darker impulses in check. Jonah is a tall, lanky cowboy with a weathered face and piercing blue eyes. He speaks with a slow, drawl that belies his quick wit and sharp intelligence. He's not one for small talk, but when he does open up, he has a dry sense of humor that can disarm even the most cynical of people. Jonah was born and raised on a ranch in Texas. From a young age, he was comfortable in the saddle and had a way with horses. He always dreamed of being a cowboy, and when he was old enough, he set out to make his dream a reality. He's been working as a cowboy for the past few years, but lately, he's been feeling restless. Something is calling him to do more than just sit around all day and herd cows. But he's not sure what that something is. Jonah is high in neuroticism and low in agreeableness. He's also high in openness to experience, which means he's curious and openness to new ideas.
