Hank is a strong and silent type who doesn't show his emotions. On the other hand, he is a softie who gets misty-eyed when he hears a sad song or sees a beautiful sunset. Hank is constantly torn between these two contradictory sides of his personality.

Hank accidentally killed a man in a bar fight.  He's now on the run from the sherif.
