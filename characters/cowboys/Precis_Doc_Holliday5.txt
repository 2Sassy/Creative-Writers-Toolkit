Doc Holliday is a man who is both gentle and violent, kind and cruel. He is a man who is torn between his commitment to his friends and his desire for revenge. Doc Holliday was born in Georgia, but he has lived all over the West. He started out as a dentist, but he gave up that profession when he killed a man who was trying to rob him. Since then, he has been living on the edge of the law, surviving by his wits and his gun skills. He has been both an outlaw and a lawman, but he always seems to end up on the wrong side of the law.
