Mimi is an eccentric woman who is passionate about her work as a paleontologist. She often gets lost in her work and forgets to take care of herself. She is kind and compassionate, but can also be forgetful and absent-minded. Mimi is a small woman with curly hair that is always a mess. She wears glasses that are always slipping down her nose. She has a high-pitched voice that tends to get shrill when she gets excited.
