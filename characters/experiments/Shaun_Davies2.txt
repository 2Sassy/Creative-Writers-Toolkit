Shaun is a big guy, over six feet tall and built like a brick sh1thouse. He has short, dark hair and blue eyes. His voice is deep and gruff.

Shaun grew up poor but he was happy. He loved classical music from an early age. When he was ten, his father died in a Trucking accident. After that, Shaun's mother had to work to support the family so Shaun spent a lot of time alone. He started hanging out with the older kids in town and getting into trouble.
