2
 

2) A tough, no-nonsense trucker from a poor community in Northern England, Alan has a strong moral compass and often ends up in trouble by defending the weak. He's intelligent and loves classical music, but he's also big and very tough, not afraid to break a few bones - his own and other people's.
 


 

3) Alan is a big man, well over six feet tall and built like a brick outhouse. He's got a wild mane of curly black hair that he often tries unsuccessfully to rein in with a leather thong, and piercing blue eyes that miss nothing. His voice is deep and rough, with a hint of something cultured beneath the gruff exterior.
 


 

4) Alan was born into a family of hard-working, blue-collar folks in Manchester. His dad was a trucker and his mom worked at the local factory. From an early age, Alan showed signs of being different from his peers. He was always getting into fights, but he was also the one who would stand up for the underdog. And while he loved nothing more than getting into mischief with his mates, he also had a passion for reading and learning. He excelled at school and won a scholarship to study at Oxford, but he turned it down, opting instead to follow in his father's footsteps and become a trucker.
 


 

5) Alan is the archetypal hero - strong, brave and determined to do what's right, even if it means putting himself in harm's way.
 


 

6) Alan is fiercely loyal and protective of those he cares about. He has a quick temper and isn't afraid to use his fists to solve problems. But beneath the rough exterior there beats the heart of a true romantic - Alan loves poetry and flowers, and often quotes Shakespeare when trying to woo the ladies.
 


 

7) According to the Big 5 personality assessment method, Alan is high in agreeableness and extraversion, moderate in conscientiousness and neuroticism, and low in openness to experience.
