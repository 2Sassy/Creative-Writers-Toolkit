Toland is a hot-headed, impulsive fighter who is fiercely loyal to his friends. He is always looking for a good brawl, but he has a deep well of compassion that he often tries to hide. He is missing two teeth in the front of his mouth, which only adds to his feral appearance. Toland is high in neuroticism, low in agreeableness, high in openness, average in extraversion and average in conscientiousness.
