Riq is a carefree and easygoing person who loves to have a good time. However, his impulsive nature often gets him into trouble. He is also fiercely independent and has a mischievous streak. Riq is of average height with a lithe build, curly brown hair and hazel eyes. He speaks with a lighthearted lilt and has a habit of whistling tunelessly when he is pleased. Riq was born in a small village on the edge of the Kingdom and ran away from home at age sixteen to join a band of adventurers. He uses his charm and quick wit to help them out of (and sometimes into) trouble.
