3) A paragraph describing what the character looks and sounds like, written in the style and voice of the novel:

Hubert Blaine Wolfe­Schonke, Esquire is a man of average height and build, though he carries himself with the air of someone much taller. His hair is dark and greased back from his forehead in a way that makes him look slightly sinister. His eyes are small and beady, darting around nervously behind his wire-rimmed glasses. He has a habit of clearing his throat constantly, as if to puncture any awkward silence that might fall between him and others. When he speaks, his voice is high-pitched and nasally, with a pronounced stutter.
