Lt. Colonel Andrew "Andy" Bryan is a courageous and patriotic man who has dedicated his life to serving his country. However, his decorated career has been plagued by one mistake that he can never forget - and that continues to haunt him.

Andy is a tall, muscular man with salt-and-pepper hair and green eyes. He walks with the authority and confidence that comes with years of military training and experience. His voice is deep and commanding, but it betrays a hint of sadness and regret.

Andy was born into a military family and grew up idolizing his father, who was a highly decorated general. He followed in his father's footsteps, attending the United States Military Academy at West Point. He had a successful career in the Army, serving in various leadership roles before being promoted to lieutenant colonel. However, his career was derailed when he made a critical error during a battle overseas that resulted in the death of several soldiers. He was court-martialed and dishonorably discharged from the Army. Since then, he has been struggling to put his life back together, working odd jobs and trying to forget his past.

Andy is haunted by his past mistake, which causes him to second-guess himself and doubt his abilities. He is also overly proud and has difficulty admitting when he's wrong. Despite these flaws, Andy is still a heroic figure who is willing to put everything on the line for his country.
