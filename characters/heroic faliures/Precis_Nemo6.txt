Nemo is a small orange fish with big blue eyes who lives in the Great Barrier Reef. He is charming, determined and resourceful, but also impulsive and headstrong. He has a tragic backstory â€“ his father was killed by a barracuda and his mother and siblings were captured by humans and taken to an aquarium. Nemo was the only one who managed to escape. He has been living on his own ever since, surviving by eating scraps from humans and hiding from predators.
