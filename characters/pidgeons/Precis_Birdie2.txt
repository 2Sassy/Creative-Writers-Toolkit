Birdie is a small bird with a big voice. She has brightly coloured feathers and a cheery song, but she is always getting into trouble because she can't help but sing at the top of her lungs.

Birdie was born in the city and has always been fascinated by the other birds. She loves to watch them fly and play, but she never dared to join in because she was afraid of getting hurt. One day, she finally summoned up the courage to fly with the other birds, but they quickly got tired of her constantly singing and chased her away. Since then, Birdie has been living on her own, coming out only at night to sing when she knows the other birds are asleep.

Birdie is independent and stubborn, which often leads her to clash with other birds. She is also shy and afraid of flying during the day.
