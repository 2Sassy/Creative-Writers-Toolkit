Pidge is a small pigeon who lives in the city. They are very friendly and enjoy being around people, but they cannot speak. Even though they can't speak, they are still able to communicate with other pigeons through cooing noises. Pidge is always exploring their surroundings and loves to watch humans from a distance.
