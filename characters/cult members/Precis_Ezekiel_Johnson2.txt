Ezekiel Johnson is a paranoid, distrustful and fiercely loyal member of an extremist Christian cult who believes that the end of the world is coming. He is constantly torn between his loyalty to the cult and his fear of the outside world. Ezekiel is a tall, thin man with wild eyes and long, stringy hair who always looks dirty and disheveled. His voice is high-pitched and paranoid, and he often talks to himself. Ezekiel was born into a poor family in Arizona. His father was an abusive drunk and his mother was a devout Christian. When Ezekiel was eight years old, his mother died in a car accident. His father became even more abusive after that, and Ezekiel ran away from home when he was sixteen. He ended up joining an extremist Christian cult, and he has been living in their compound ever since.
