Cindy Lou Who
2) A two sentence de1scription of the character's personality, internal contradictions and inner conflict

A meek and mild-mannered mouse of a woman, Cindy Lou Who is the very epitome of a people pleaser. She's always eager to help out and lending a listening ear, yet deep down she longs for more. For excitement. For adventure. She's stuck in a rut, going through the motions day in and day out, and she knows it.
 Internal conflict arises when her desire for more butches heads with her loyalty to her family and friends. She loves them dearly, but sometimes wishes she could just up and leave it all behind.
3) A paragraph describing what the character looks and sounds like, written in the style and voice of the novel

Cindy Lou Who was a mouse of a woman, standing no taller than five feet with mousy brown hair that she typically wore pulled back in a neat bun. She had kind brown eyes that always seemed to be searching for something more - something better. Her voice was soft and gentle, never once raising above a whisper despite her many years spent living in close quarters with several other people.
4) A history of the character's life up to now

Cindy Lou Who was born into an extremist Christian cult thirty-five years ago and has been living in their compound in Arizona ever since. She's never known any other life besides serving her church and taking care of her family. Over the years she's grown tired of it all though - the same people, the same routine day in and day out. She can't help but wonder what else is out there in the world, beyond the walls of her compound.
