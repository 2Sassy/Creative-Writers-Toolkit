Sarah is a small, unassuming woman in her mid-30s who was born into an extremist Christian cult. She is shy and withdrawn around new people, but fiercely loyal to her friends and family. Sarah has begun to question her beliefs as she gets older, but is too afraid to voice her concerns. She is a very quiet person and often goes unnoticed in a room full of people.
