Sister Sarah is a meek and gentle person who is fiercely loyal to her cult. She is torn between her desire to please her doomsday prophet father and her own spiritual beliefs. Sarah is a gaunt woman with wild eyes and thin, stringy hair. She always looks like she's on the verge of a breakdown. Her voice is high and shrill, and she often slips into religious trance-like states when she speaks. Sarah was raised in the cult compound from birth. Her father is the cult leader, and she has always been indoctrinated into their apocalyptic beliefs. She has never left the compound, and her only contact with the outside world are the weekly broadcasts her father makes to his followers. Sarah is low in extraversion, high in neuroticism, high in agreeableness, low in conscientiousness, and high in openness to experience.
