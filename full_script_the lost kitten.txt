SCENE 1

INT. BARN - DAY

The three kittens are playing in the barn. Mitten is leading the game, with Maisy and Duke following close behind. They are running and climbing, and having a great time. The leader's name is Mitten, a curious and brave kitten. The other two are Maisy, a shy kitten, and Duke, an easily led but much younger kitten.


MITTEN:
Come on, guys! This is fun!


MAISY:
I'm not so sure...


DUKE:
I'm scared...


MITTEN:
Don't be scared, Duke! I'll protect you!


MAISY:
Okay, I'll try it...


DUKE:
Okay...



SCENE 2

EXT. BARN - DAY

Mitten notices the door to the barn has been left open. He's curious and wanders over to it. Maisy isn't so sure. Duke would love to go out and explore - he wants to walk right out. They look outside to see the farmyard. They've never been there. Masey doesn't want to go out, she's too scared. Mitten would like to go out, but feels he must protect the others, so he discourages Duke.

MITTEN:
Wow, guys, look at that!


MAISY:
What is it?


DUKE:
It's the farmyard! I've never seen it before...


MITTEN:
It looks like a lot of fun! But we shouldn't go out there...


DUKE:
Why not?


MITTEN:
Well, we don't know what's out there. It could be dangerous.


MAISY:
I don't want to go out there! It looks scary...


DUKE:
I'm not scared! I want to explore!


MITTEN:
No, Duke, we can't go out there. We have to stay here in the barn. It's not safe.DUKE:
Aww, man...SCENE 3

INT. BARN - DAY

Mitten tries to distract Duke and Maisy from the open door by getting them to play a game.

MITTEN:
Okay, guys, let's play a game!


DUKE:
What game?


MITTEN:
How about hide-and-seek? I'll count to 100 and you guys can hide, and then I'll come and find you!


MAISY:
Okay...


DUKE:
Yay, this is going to be so much fun!


MITTEN:
One... two... three... four... five...(Maisy and Duke start to hide)


MITTEN:
... ninety-nine... one hundred! Okay, here I come!(Mitten starts to look for Duke and Maisy)



SCENE 4

EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

While they're playing, Duke walks out of the door to explore. Neither of the other two notice him going.

MAISY:
(Sneezes)


MOTHER:
(Wakes up) Maisy, be quiet.  Mummy's trying to sleep!


MAISY:
I'm sorry, Mother, I didn't mean to...


MOTHER:
Never mind, just remember to stay inside the barn. I'm going back to my nap.


MAISY:
Okay...


(Mother goes back to sleep)


MITTEN:
Maisy, I have something to tell you...


MAISY:
What is it?


MITTEN:
Duke... he's gone. He walked out of the door while we were playing and he's nowhere to be seen.

 MAISY: Oh no! We have to tell Mother!

 Mitten shook his head. 

 MITTEN: No, if we tell her, she'll be so angry. We'll get into trouble.  We have to find Duke ourselves.

 MAISY: Okay, but where do we start looking?

 Mitten thought for a moment. 

 MITTEN: I don't know... but we'll think of something. Come on, let's go!



SCENE 5

EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

Masey and Mitten creep out of the barn and into the farmyard. 


MITTEN:
Come on, Maisy, we have to find Duke.


MAISY:
I'm scared, Mitten. This is a big world.  What if we can't find him?


MITTEN:
Don't worry, we'll find him. I'll take care of you.


The two cats explore the farmyard together, looking for their brother Duke. Every now and then, they call out his name, but there's no response.


MAISY:
Duke! Duke, where are you?

                   MITTEN:             Duke! Here, kitty kitty!

 They look in all sorts of places - under bushes, in trees, in the barn - but there's no sign of Duke anywhere. 

 MAISY: He's not here... maybe he went back inside the barn? 

 Mittens shook his head. 

 MITTEN: I don't think so... I think he would have come to find us if he had gone inside. No, he's out here somewhere... we just have to keep looking.



SCENE 6

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Mitten and Masey follow Duke's paw prints into the forest. 


MAISY:
I don't like this place, Mitten. It's dark and scary.


MITTEN:
I know, but we have to find Duke. His paw prints lead this way.


They call out for Duke as they walk, but there's no response. The forest is eerily quiet. Suddenly, Mitten hears something. 


MITTEN:
Shh! Maisy, do you hear that?

Quick, Mitten, let's go the other way!


But the fox is friendly. He introduces himself as Freddy.FREDDY:
Hi there! I'm Freddy the fox. I live in this forest.


MITTEN:
Do you know where we might find our brother, Duke? He ran off into the forest and we're worried about him.


FREDDY:
I haven't seen any other kittens around here, but there are lots of other animals who live in this forest. Maybe one of them has seen him.MITTEN:
Thanks, Freddy. We'll keep looking.


FREDDY:
Good luck!

MITTEN:
Excuse me, mister bear, have you seen a kitten around here? His name is Duke and he ran off into the forest.


BEAR:
What do you want? Can't you see I'm trying to sleep?


MITTEN:
I'm sorry, we didn't mean to disturb you. We're just looking for our brother. 


The bear stops and looks at them. He seems tired and upset.

BEAR:
I'm lost. I've been walking around in circles for hours and I can't find my way back to my house.


Mitten feels sorry for the bear. He's obviously very tired and upset.


MITTEN:
Don't worry, we'll help you find your way back.



SCENE 9

EXT. FOREST - DAY

As the three walk through the forest, Mitten realises they've passed the bear's house already.

MITTEN:
I think I know where your house is. We passed it just after we met the fox.
 
The bear is surprised and delighted.


BEAR:
Really? Show me the way!

 
Mitten leads the way back to the bear's house. He is relieved they found it so easily.

 
MITTEN:
Here it is!

 
The bear goes into his house and Mitten and Masey say goodbye.

Look who I found!

 
Duke is delighted to see his brother and sister again.

 
DUKE:
I found this shelter just after I left the farmyard. I've been having a lovely sleep here ever since.

 
Mitten and Masey are relieved to have found Duke safe and sound. They all say goodbye to the bear and head back home together.

 
MITTEN:
Come on, let's go home!






SCENE 11

The kittens walk back through the forest, following the paw prints Duke left on the way in. They're glad to find their way back into the farmyard and see that their barn is still open.

 
MITTEN:
Phew, we made it!

 
The kittens go into the barn and lie down in their bed of hay.

 
MASEY:
That was quite an adventure!

 
DUKE:
I'm just glad we're all safe and sound.

 
Later, we see the kittens snuggled up in their bed of hay, contentedly dreaming about their exciting adventure.
