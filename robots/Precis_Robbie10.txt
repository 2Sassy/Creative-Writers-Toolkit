Robbie is a shy robot who is always searching for companionship. However, due to his shyness, he often comes off as cold and unapproachable. As a result, he often feels lonely and isolated.
 
 Robbie was created by a team of scientists who were trying to create the perfect robot companion. However, they soon realised that Robbie was too shy to be an effective companion and so they abandoned him. Robbie has been living on his own ever since.
