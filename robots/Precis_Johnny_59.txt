Johnny 5 is a small, unassuming robot who has a knife hidden up his sleeve. He is paranoid that someone will stick a knife in his back, and he is always looking over his shoulder. He is an extroverted sensor who thinks before he feels. He is also a perceiver, which means he is flexible and adaptable.
