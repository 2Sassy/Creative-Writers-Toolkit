POV: Dave.  Third Person perspective.
EMOTION: Susan is angry.  Dave is defeated.

The room felt empty, stiffling.  White walls made it feel strangely smaller.  There were no windows, as though there was nothing to see.  As though the universe ended at the brickwork.  Dave felt as though, if he put his hand against the plaster, he would feel the ice of space.  Absolute zero, absolute void, and eternity stretching away.

 A single bulb hung on its bare wire from the ceiling.  It swung slightly in a breeze that must have come from nowhere.  Dave couldn't feel the breeze anyhow.  The light was harsh.  It was one of those old fashioned filament bulbs, a stinging burning wire encased in razor-thin glass.  A yellow interrogator.  Where it shone, nothing could be hidden.  Where its shadows fell, they were a solid, untextured blackness.  Its flex offered hanging or electrocution as Dave's only escape from this moment.

Dave stared through the light at Susan.  The last of his anger was spent now, but he could see in her eyes that hers still burned. He waited for it to die.  It didn't.  He put out a hand, rested it on her arm, and spoke softly.

"I know what you're thinking," he said.

She glared at him.  "Do you, Dave?  Do you really?" The words came out like machine-gun fire.

Dave pulled his hand back, shoved it into a pocket.  He looked away, at the bare walls.  His eyes searched for something to fix on.  They found nothing.  He returned them to hers, but unable to hold her gaze, he looked at his shoes.  He shrugged.

"No," he said, "I know nothing.  Nothing at all."

When he looked back up, she blinked.  Maybe there was something, something softer in her eyes, some aspect of consiliation.  Maybe it was just his imagination.  He took a long, deep breath, sucking in the oxygen-starved air, and then letting it go in a slow, ragged exhalation.

He turned away.
