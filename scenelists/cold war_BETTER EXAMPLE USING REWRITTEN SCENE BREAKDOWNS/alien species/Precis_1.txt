The alien in the text is an aggressive creature that is torn between its desire to destroy and its curiosity towards humans. It is a tall, slim creature with green skin, large black eyes, and four long fingers. The alien speaks in a screeching voice that is difficult for humans to understand. It hails from a planet that is very different from Earth, and is the only form of intelligent life on its planet. The creature is a combination of the Explorer and Warrior archetypes, and has some quirks that are unusual for humans, such as being insensitive to emotions and having superior physical abilities.
