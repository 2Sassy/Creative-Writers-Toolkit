INT. TRAINING BASE - DAY

We see a group of young men in their early 20s going through a series of physical and mental tests. They are all clad in navy-issued gear and look exhausted. Among them is ALEX, who is struggling to keep up. His commanding officer, JOHN, is constantly berating him.


		JOHN
Come on, you worthless piece of shit!  Move it!  You're falling behind the others!

		ALEX
( panting) I'm... trying, sir...

		JOHN
(grabbing him by the collar) Try harder, damn it!  If you don't shape up soon, you're going to be washed out of this place!

ALEX continues to struggle through the training, but he is clearly not cut out for it. He falls behind more and more with each passing day. Finally, JOHN has had enough.
