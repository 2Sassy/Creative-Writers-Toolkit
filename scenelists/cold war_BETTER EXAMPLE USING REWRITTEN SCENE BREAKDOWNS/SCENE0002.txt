We see Alex in the canteen.  The other soldiers are bullying him.  He's trying to eat, but another cadet takes his food and throws it at him.  he reacts, but the training officer appears, and takes the other cadet's side, shouting Alex down, and sending him outside to work in the rain as punishment.

we see alex working in the rain.  he struggles to do the menial job he's been given.  All the other cadets are in the mess hall relaxing.
