We see Alex a few months later.  He has graduated, and been assigned a job on the radar of a nuclear submarine.  He is constantly on edge.  The submarine is patroling in Russian waters.  They have to keep very quiet in order to avoid being found by Russians.

on the radar, alex spots a russian ship.  His commanding officer hates him and doesn't think the radar signal means anything.  The captain wants to surface.  He's dismissive of the danger.

Alex convinces the captain after a long conversation that he needs to check with the periscope first.

when they do check, the captain realises Alex was right.  Everyone is releaved.  The crew start to like Alex, and he gains the captain's respect.
