INT. TRAINING BASE - BARRACKS - DAY

Alex is in bed, writing a letter home. He looks unhappy and questioning why he ever joined up in the first place. His companions don't seem to care.

(writing) Dear Mum and Dad, I'm not sure why I joined the Navy.  It doesn't seem like it was the right decision.  I'm not doing well here.  The other soldiers pick on me and the training is hard.  I miss you both so much.  I just wish I was home with you now.  Love, Alex.
