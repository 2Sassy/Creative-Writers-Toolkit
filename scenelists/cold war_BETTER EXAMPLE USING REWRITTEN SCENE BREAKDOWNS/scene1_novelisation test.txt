
It was raining again.  Of course.  Alex struggled to see through the downpour as he ran towards the Submarine Training Base.  He was already soaked to the bone and shivering uncontrollably, but he knew that if he was late for training, Commander Johnson would make him do extra laps.  He didn't think he could take another lap around the base - his legs were already throbbing and his lungs felt like they were on fire.

As he rounded the corner into the training area, he saw the other recruits sprinting towards the finish line.  He was so far behind.  Commander Johnson was going to kill him.

He pushed himself harder, but it was no use.  He could barely move his legs anymore and his vision was starting to blur.  He wasn't going to make it.

Suddenly, Commander Johnson's voice boomed through the rain. "What the hell are you doing, recruit?  Do you want to be a goddamn sailor or not?"

Alex gasped for breath, trying to reply, but all that came out was a weak croak. "Yes sir... I'm sorry sir."

Commander Johnson snarled. "Sorry doesn't cut it! You're a disgrace to the navy! Now get your ass in gear or you'll be cleaning latrines for the next month!"

Alex felt his stomach drop.  There was no way he could make it now - he'd never be able to keep up with the other recruits.  Disheartened, he trudged back towards the starting line, wondering what he was doing wrong.
