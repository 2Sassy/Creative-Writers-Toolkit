INT. submarine - day

( we see Alex in his bunk, writing in a journal. He looks troubled.)

		ALEX (voiceover)
I can't forget what we did...the innocent people we killed. I can't keep doing this.

		(We see him tearing up the journal and throwing it across the room. He looks conflicted and uncertain.)

		ALEX (voiceover)
But what can I do? I can't just leave the submarine...

		(We see him getting up and putting on his uniform. He takes a deep breath and squares his shoulders, then heads out.)


CUT TO:

INT. submarine - control room

(Alex is back on duty, manning the controls. He looks calmer now, as if he's made a decision.)

		ALEX (voiceover)
I'm going to stay on the submarine and try to make a difference. Maybe I can help prevent something like this from happening again.
