SCREENPLAY:

INT. submarine - day

(We see ALEX aboard the submarine, still in the middle of the Cold War. He's in his bunk, trying to sleep, when he's suddenly called to the control room.)

		ALEX
(to himself)
What's going on?

(He gets up and goes to the control room, where he sees the captain and first mate.)

		CAPTAIN
(to Alex)
We've got word that we're going to be attacking a Russian base. Are you up for it?

		ALEX
(hesitates)
Sir, I don't think this is a good idea...there are innocent people there.

		CAPTAIN
(interrupting)
I don't care. We have our orders. Get to your station.

		ALEX
(reluctantly)
Yes, sir.
