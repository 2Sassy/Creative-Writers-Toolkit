SCREENPLAY:

INT. submarine - day

(We see ALEX, now a few months older, aboard a submarine. He's in the middle of the Cold War and is constantly on edge. Other crew members are also present, but they're relaxed compared to Alex. There's a tense atmosphere aboard the submarine.)

		ALEX
(to himself)
I can't believe I'm actually here. In the middle of the Cold War.

(He looks around at the other crew members and notices they're all relaxed. He starts to relax as well.)

Maybe it's not so bad after all.
