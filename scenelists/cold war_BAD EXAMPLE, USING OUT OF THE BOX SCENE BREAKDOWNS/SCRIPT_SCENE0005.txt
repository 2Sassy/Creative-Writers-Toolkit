SCREENPLAY:

INT. submarine - day

(We see the submarine coming back to base. Alex is in the control room, looking tired and defeated. The rest of the crew is celebrating.)

		CREW MEMBER
(to Alex)
Hey, we did it!

		ALEX
(nods)
Yeah...we did it.

		CREW MEMBER
What's wrong? You should be celebrating!

		ALEX
(sighs)
I just can't forget about the people we killed...they didn't deserve that.

		CREW MEMBER
(shrugs)
It's war, man. Bad things are going to happen. You can't dwell on it.

		ALEX
(nods)
I know...I just can't help it.
