Captain Unusual is a superhero who is tall, muscular, and has chiselled features. He is very confident and courageous on the surface, but is actually quite insecure and often second-guesses his decisions. This internal conflict can sometimes result in paralysis, preventing him from taking action even when it is urgently needed. Captain Unusual was born with a very rare genetic condition that gave him superhuman strength and agility. As a child, he was often bullied and teased because of his unusual appearance. However, he soon learned to use his powers to stand up for himself and others. After discovering his true calling as a superhero, he worked hard to hone his skills and become the best hero he could be.
