NOTE:  THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF SCRIPT YOU GET IF YOU JUST ACCEPT THE SCENE BREAKDOWN YOU'RE GIVEN BY THE SYSTEM.

BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH DETAIL IN THE SCENE0001,0002, ETC. FILES, YOU GET A SCRIPT THAT TELLS THE STORY IN A BLAND WAY.

YOU NEED TO PERSONALLY EDIT EACH SCENE FILE TO GET A GOOD RESULT.  



INT. submarine training base - day

(We see ALEX, a young man in his early twenties, going through a training exercise. He's struggling, but he's determined to make it through. A few other trainees are also in the room, but they're not as focused as Alex.)

		TRAINER
(shouting)
Come on, Alex! You're not doing yourself any favors by quitting now!

		ALEX
(to himself)
I can do this. I'm not going to quit.

(He continues the exercise and eventually completes it. The other trainees congratulates him.)TRAINER
(to Alex)
Good job, son. You've got what it takes to be a submariner.ALEX
Thank you, sir.



SCREENPLAY:

INT. submarine - day

(We see ALEX, now a few months older, aboard a submarine. He's in the middle of the Cold War and is constantly on edge. Other crew members are also present, but they're relaxed compared to Alex. There's a tense atmosphere aboard the submarine.)

		ALEX
(to himself)
I can't believe I'm actually here. In the middle of the Cold War.

(He looks around at the other crew members and notices they're all relaxed. He starts to relax as well.)

		ALEX
(to himself)
Maybe it's not so bad after all.



SCREENPLAY:

INT. submarine - day

(We see ALEX aboard the submarine, still in the middle of the Cold War. He's in his bunk, trying to sleep, when he's suddenly called to the control room.)

		ALEX
(to himself)
What's going on?

(He gets up and goes to the control room, where he sees the captain and first mate.)

		CAPTAIN
(to Alex)
We've got word that we're going to be attacking a Russian base. Are you up for it?

		ALEX
(hesitates)
Sir, I don't think this is a good idea...there are innocent people there.

		CAPTAIN
(interrupting)
I don't care. We have our orders. Get to your station.

		ALEX
(reluctantly)
Yes, sir.



SCREENPLAY:

INT. submarine - day

(We see ALEX in the control room, getting ready for the attack. He's wearing his helmet and has a serious look on his face.)

		CAPTAIN
(to Alex)
Are you ready?

		ALEX
(nods)
Yes, sir.

		CAPTAIN
(to everyone)
All right, let's do this.

(They launch their attack and it's devastating. Alex sees firsthand the destruction they've caused. He's ravaged with guilt and can't believe what he's done.)

		ALEX
(to himself)
This is a nightmare...FADE TO BLACK.



SCREENPLAY:

INT. submarine - day

(We see the submarine coming back to base. Alex is in the control room, looking tired and defeated. The rest of the crew is celebrating.)

		CREW MEMBER
(to Alex)
Hey, we did it!

		ALEX
(nods)
Yeah...we did it.

		CREW MEMBER
What's wrong? You should be celebrating!

		ALEX
(sighs)
I just can't forget about the people we killed...they didn't deserve that.

		CREW MEMBER
(shrugs)
It's war, man. Bad things are going to happen. You can't dwell on it.

		ALEX
(nods)
I know...I just can't help it.

 FADE TO BLACK



INT. submarine - day

( we see Alex in his bunk, writing in a journal. He looks troubled.)

		ALEX (voiceover)
I can't forget what we did...the innocent people we killed. I can't keep doing this.

		(We see him tearing up the journal and throwing it across the room. He looks conflicted and uncertain.)

		ALEX (voiceover)
But what can I do? I can't just leave the submarine...

		(We see him getting up and putting on his uniform. He takes a deep breath and squares his shoulders, then heads out.)


CUT TO:

INT. submarine - control room

(Alex is back on duty, manning the controls. He looks calmer now, as if he's made a decision.)

		ALEX (voiceover)
I'm going to stay on the submarine and try to make a difference. Maybe I can help prevent something like this from happening again.

 FADE TO BLACK
