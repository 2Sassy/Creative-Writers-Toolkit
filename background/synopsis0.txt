But she's never been satisfied, always wanting more and more. She's always caused trouble, causing her parents to give up on her.

As they get to know each other, Gerta starts to see Viktor in a different light. He's not the trophy man she thought he was, but a kind and gentle person who has been through a lot in life. She starts to fall in love with him, even though she knows it can't possibly work out between them. But just when it seems like Gerta might finally be happy, Viktor is killed in a car accident.
