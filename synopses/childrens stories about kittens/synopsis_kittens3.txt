The story begins with a little girl who is trying to go to bed, but she can't because she's too excited. She's just adopted a kitten, and she can't wait to introduce her to her parents. But when she gets to her room, the kitten is nowhere to be found. She looks all over the house for her, but she can't find her. She's about to give up when she hears a meow coming from her closet. She opens the door and sure enough, there's her kitten. She's relieved and happy to have found her. But then she realizes that the kitten is stuck in the closet and she can't get out. She tries to push the door open, but it's too heavy. She tries to squeeze through the opening, but she gets stuck. She starts to panic when she hears her parents coming up the stairs. She knows they're going to be so mad if they find out she let the kitten into the house. She starts to cry and the kitten starts to meow. But then she hears her parents coming into the room and she knows she has to do something. She takes a deep breath and squeezes through the opening, just as her parents come into the room. They're surprised to see her, but they're even more surprised when they see the kitten coming out of the closet. They're happy to see that she's safe and sound. And they're glad that their little girl was able to save her.
