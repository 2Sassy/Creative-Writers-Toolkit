The story begins with a group of kittens who live in a warm and cozy barn. They are content playing and napping in the hay, but they always wonder what it would be like to explore the big world outside. One day, when the farmer is away, they take their opportunity to sneak out and start their own great adventure. The kittens soon find themselves in a forest full of strange and wonderful creatures. They meet a friendly fox who tells them about the different animals who live there and how to find their way back home. They also meet a grumpy bear who doesn't want to be bothered, but the kittens quickly learn that he's just grumpy because he's lost his way home. With the help of their new friends, the kittens eventually find their way back to the barn safe and sound. The story ends with the kittens snuggled up in their bed of hay, contentedly dreaming about their exciting adventure.
