The story begins with a group of kittens who are very curious and want to explore the world outside. Their mother tells them that they need to wait until they are grown up before they can go outside. The kittens get impatient and one day, when their mother is taking a nap, they sneak out. While they are outside, they meet a big, mean cat who chases them. They are terrified and run back home. When their mother wakes up and sees that they are back, she scolds them and tells them how dangerous it is to go outside. She explains that they need to be patient and wait until they are grown up before they can explore the world. The kittens are very sad and apologize to their mother. They promise to be patient and wait until they are grown up before they go outside again.
