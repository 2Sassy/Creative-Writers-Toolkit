The story begins with a group of kittens who live in a home with a loving family. The kittens are happy and content, but they always seem to be getting into mischief. One night, the kittens get into the family's Cookie Jar and eat all of the cookies. The family is very upset and sternly scolds the kittens. The kittens are so sorry for what they did and promise to never do it again. The next day, the kittens get into the family's Christmas tree and knock it over. The family is so angry that they decide to give the kittens away to a new home. The kittens are very sad and scared as they are taken away from their family. They are taken to a new home where they meet a kindly old woman who loves them and takes care of them. They live happily ever after with their new owner and never get into any more mischief.
