The story begins with Harry Potter receiving a letter from an owl. He is surprised to see that the letter is addressed to him, as he does not know anyone in Australia. The letter is from a woman named Hermione Granger, who says that she is a big fan of Harry's and has been following his story since he first arrived at Hogwarts. Hermione says that she is coming to Australia to meet Harry and to offer her help in any way possible. Harry is sceptical at first, but decides to meet with Hermione. He is surprised to find that she is a very good friend and helps him with his magical studies. Together, they help each other fight against the Dark Lord Voldemort. They also become good friends with Ron Weasley and Ginny Weasley. Throughout the story, there are many references to Australian culture and customs. For example, when Hermione first meets Harry, she gives him a Vegemite sandwich. Harry also learns about Australian animals, such as the kangaroo and the koala. The story culminates with a final battle against Voldemort in which Harry and his friends triumph. Afterwards, they all return to their homes in England.
