The story begins with Harry Potter and Hermione Granger being dead. Killed by Voldemort in the final battle, they find themselves in a strange place. It is not the afterlife that they were expecting, but instead it is a place that exists between life and death. They soon realize that they are not alone in this place and that there are others like them, people who have died but are not yet ready to move on. Harry and Hermione meet a man named Tom Riddle, who tells them that they are in purgatory. He explains that they must complete a task before they can move on to the next stage of their journey. The task is to save another soul from purgatory and Tom tells them that the soul they must save is that of Sirius Black. Sirius is another victim of Voldemort's reign of terror and he too finds himself in purgatory. He is angry and resentful at being stuck in this place and is unwilling to help Harry and Hermione. However, after getting to know them better, he realizes that they are good people and agrees to help them on their quest. The three of them set out together and eventually find themselves in a place called the Forbidden Forest. This is where Sirius's soul is being held captive by a creature called a Dementor. The Dementor is feeding off of Sirius's negative emotions andHarry, Hermione, and Tom must find a way to break its hold over him. After a long and difficult battle, they are successful in defeating the Dementor and freeing Sirius's soul. He thanks them for their help and tells them that he will now be able to move on. Harry and Hermione now know that they too can move on from this place and begin their journey to the afterlife.
