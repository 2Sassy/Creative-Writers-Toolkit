The story begins in the usual fashion, with Harry Potter and his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger attending their first year of wizarding school at Hogwarts. However, things quickly take a turn for the bizarre when Harry is informed by the talking, magical Sorting Hat that he is to be sorted into the Slytherin House. Unhappy with this turn of events, Harry unsuccessfully tries to get sorted into another House. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that there is something definitely not right at Hogwarts. Teachers and students alike are acting strangely; some are outright hostile to Harry and his friends. They soon discover that the source of the trouble is Lord Voldemort, who has taken over the school in an attempt to find and kill Harry Potter. In the climactic final battle, Harry and his friends face off against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Using their combined powers, they are able to defeat Voldemort once and for all. With peace restored to Hogwarts, everyone goes back to their normal lives... or do they? The story ends with a hint that there may be more to come, as Ron and Hermione say goodbye to Harry at the wizarding school platform, leaving him with a knowing look on his face as the train departs for the next year at Hogwarts.
