The story begins with a young woman, Sarah, who is about to be married off to a man she does not know. Her mother tells her that she must go through with the marriage, as it has been arranged by their family for generations. Sarah is reluctant, but she knows that she must obey her mother. The night before her wedding, Sarah sneaks out of the house to meet with her childhood friend, John. They have always been close, but they have never been able to act on their feelings for each other because of their different social class. Sarah tells John that she does not want to go through with the marriage, and John says that he will help her escape. The next morning, Sarah's wedding day, John comes to her rescue and helps her escape the altar. They flee the town together and start a new life in the wilderness. They build a cabin together and live off the land. They are happy for a time, but eventually they realize that they are not truly free. They are living in fear of being caught and returned to their old lives. They decide to fight for their freedom and start a rebellion against the ruling class. The rebellion is successful and Sarah and John are finally free to live their lives together. They settle down in their cabin in the woods and live happily ever after.
