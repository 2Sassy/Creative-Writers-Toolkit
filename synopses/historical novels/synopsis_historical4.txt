The story begins in the year 1815, at the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Europe is in a state of flux, and England is no exception. The aristocratic families who have held power for centuries are being challenged by a new breed of wealthy industrialists. Among them is the Dashwood family, who have made their fortune in coal mining. The patriarch of the family, Henry Dashwood, dies suddenly, leaving his wife and three daughters penniless. His son from his first marriage, John, inherits the family estate. John is a cold and distant man, more concerned with his own status than with his stepmother and half-sisters. Faced with the prospect of being turned out of their home, Mrs Dashwood and her daughters take refuge with their cousin, Sir John Middleton. Sir John is a kind-hearted man who takes them under his wing, and they soon feel at home in their new surroundings. One of Sir John's closest friends is Colonel Brandon, a retired military man who lives nearby. Colonel Brandon is secretly in love with Marianne Dashwood, the youngest of the sisters. Marianne is initially dismissive of him, but she comes to appreciate his quiet strength and constancy after she suffers a broken heart. The story reaches its climax when Marianne falls ill with a fever and is on the brink of death. Colonel Brandon finally declares his love for her, and she returns his affections. They are married soon afterwards, and live happily ever after.
