The story begins with a bang, or more accurately, a series of them. Gunshots ring out in the night, shattering the peace of a London suburb. When the police arrive on the scene, they find three bodies: a man and two women. All three have been shot execution-style. The man is quickly identified as David Warner, a criminal defense lawyer with a reputation for getting his clients off on even the most serious of charges. The women are less easily identified. They are eventually identified as Warner's wife and daughter. The police immediately focus their attention on Warner's clients. They soon identify one client in particular, a man named Liam O'Connor, as their prime suspect. O'Connor has a history of violence and was recently released from prison after serving time for assaulting his ex-wife. The police put O'Connor under surveillance and eventually catch him trying to dispose of the gun used in the murders. They arrest him and charge him with three counts of first-degree murder. O'Connor goes to trial and is represented by a new lawyer, a woman named Riley Stone. Stone is just as tough as her predecessor and quickly gets O'Connor off on all charges. The murders remain unsolved. Stone is hailed as a hero by the media and O'Connor disappears back into the underworld from which he came. The story ends with a final bang, as Stone is shot dead in her office by an unknown assailant.
