The story begins with our protagonist, a young woman named Katie, waking up from a nap in her car. It's been a long day of driving and she's finally made it to her destination: an isolated cabin in the woods that belongs to her boyfriend Jake's family. Jake had to return home unexpectedly and couldn't stay with her, so he told her she could use the cabin for a few days to relax and get some writing done. As Katie stretches and steps out of her car, she notices something strange. There are what look like bite marks on her arm. She assumes she must have bumped into something while she was driving and doesn't think much of it. She grabs her things and heads into the cabin. Once inside, Katie begins to feel sick. She has a headache and feels like she might vomit. She decides to lie down for a bit and see if she can sleep it off. A few hours later, Katie wakes up disoriented and confused. She feels even worse than before and now there is blood on her hands and clothes. She staggers to the bathroom mirror to see what's going on and is horrified to see that her eyes are sunken in, her skin is pale, and she has gore around her mouth. It dawns on Katie that she must be a zombie. She starts to panic as she realizes that she has no idea how this happened or what she should do next. Just then, Jake walks in - he's also a zombie! - And they stare at each other in horror before embracing each other in a hug...of death? END SYNOPSIS: While Katie and Jake are trying to figure out what's going on, they hear moaning coming from outside the cabin. They peek out the window to see a horde of zombies approaching! They quickly realize they're now surrounded by the undead and are trapped in the cabin with no way out. Katie and Jake are now forced to find a way to survive against all odds - will they be able to make it through the night? Can their love for each other keep them going? Or will they become zombies themselves?
