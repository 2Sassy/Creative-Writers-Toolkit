The story begins with the main character, Jeremy, getting ready for his date with the girl of his dreams, Jessica. He's nervous and unsure of what to expect, but he's hopeful that things will go well. On his way to pick her up, he gets a flat tire and has to walk the rest of the way. When he finally arrives at her house, he finds that she's not home. He decides to wait for her on the porch, but falls asleep. He's awoken by a noise and sees Jessica coming towards him, but something is wrong. She's covered in blood and seems to be growling. At first he thinks she's joking around, but soon realizes that she's a zombie. He tries to run away, but she grabs him and bites his arm. As he's turning into a zombie himself, he looks into her eyes and realizes that she still loves him. The story ends with the two of them walking hand in hand into the sunset as undead zombies.
