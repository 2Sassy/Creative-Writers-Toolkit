The story begins with the arrival of a group of human explorers on an alien planet. The planet is inhabited by a race of intelligent aliens called the Dramiens. The humans are immediately impressed by the aliens' advanced technology and their builders. However, they soon realize that the Dramiens are not friendly. The aliens attack the humans and capture them. The humans are taken to the Dramiens' capital city, where they are put on trial. The aliens accuse the humans of being "invaders" and demand that they be destroyed. However, the humans argue that they are not invaders, but merely explorers. They point out that they have come in peace and have no intention of harming the Dramiens. The aliens are not convinced, but they decide to spare the humans for now. They send them back to their ship and warn them to never return. The human explorers are confused and angry about what happened. They decide to go back to Earth and tell their story. However, when they arrive, they find that their planet has been destroyed by an alien race called the Zoarites. The Zoarites were at war with the Dramiens, and they decided to destroy Earth in order to get revenge on the humans. The humans are now the last survivors of their race, and they must find a way to survive in a hostile galaxy. END SYNOPSIS
