The story begins with a young couple, John and Mary, who are very much in love and expecting their first child. They are both excited and nervous about becoming parents. The pregnancy goes smoothly and they have a beautiful baby girl. A few months after the baby is born, John and Mary start to notice that she is not developing like other babies her age. She does not babble or coo, she does not reach for things, and she does not make eye contact. They take her to the doctor and are told that she has autism. This news is devastating to John and Mary. They do not know how to care for a child with autism or how to help her develop and grow. They read books and talk to experts, but nothing seems to help. As the years go by, they watch as their daughter grows into a young woman who is very intelligent but cannot communicate or interact with others. One day, John and Mary receive a call from a scientist who has been working on a new treatment for autism. He tells them about a clinical trial that he thinks their daughter might be eligible for. They agree to participate in the trial and their daughter is given a new medication. The medication works wonders! For the first time in her life, their daughter begins to communicate with them and interact with other people. She even starts to make friends. John and Mary are overjoyed at the progress their daughter is making. The clinical trial is set to end in a few weeks, but the scientist tells them that he has been able to secure funding to continue the research. John and Mary are so grateful that they will be able to continue giving their daughter this life-changing medication.
