The story begins with a family of four enjoying a lovely day out at the park. The sun is shining and the children are playing and laughing. Suddenly, a stranger approaches them and begins to tell them a strange story. The stranger claims to be a time traveler and says that he has come from the future to warn them about a great danger. The family is skeptical at first, but the stranger is so convincing that they eventually believe him. He tells them that in the future, there will be a terrible war that will destroy the world as we know it. Millions of people will die, and only a few will survive. He says that the family must leave immediately and go into hiding if they want to survive. The children are scared and don't want to go, but the stranger is so convincing that they eventually agree. The family packs up their things and leaves immediately. They go into hiding in a remote cabin in the woods. For years, they live in fear, never knowing when the war will begin. But eventually, the day comes when they hear the bombs falling and they know their time has run out. They all hug each other tightly, knowing that this is the end. But then, just as suddenly as the bombs began falling, they stop. There is silence all around them. Slowly, they venture out of their cabin to see what has happened. They can't believe their eyes: the war is over and the world is still intact! The stranger had been telling the truth all along; he really was from the future. The family is relieved and grateful to have been given this second chance at life.
