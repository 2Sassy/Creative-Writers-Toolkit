The story begins with a mother and her young daughter, Leah, arriving at Leah's grandparents' house in the small town of Glen cove. Leah is excited to see her grandparents, whom she has not seen in several years, but her mother is nervous. Leah's grandfather, a retired police officer, has been diagnosed with dementia and her mother is not sure how he will react to Leah. As it turns out, Leah's grandfather is happy to see her and the three of them spend the day catching up. Leah tells her grandfather about her school and her friends and he tells her stories about his time as a police officer. Towards the end of the day, Leah's grandmother asks her to help with dinner. Leah is happy to help and she asks her grandfather if he will tell her more stories while they cook. Leah and her grandfather spend the next few days together cooking, cleaning and spending time outside. Leah learns a lot about her grandfather and his life as a police officer. He tells her stories about the people he met, the things he saw and the crimes he solved. One night, Leah's grandfather tells her a story about a young girl who was kidnapped by a man who was never caught. He tells Leah that the case has always bothered him and that he never stopped thinking about it. The next day, Leah asks her mother if she can help her grandfather solve the case. Her mother is hesitant but eventually agrees. Leah and her grandfather spend the next few weeks going through old files and talking to people who knew the victim. They finally come up with a suspect: the victim's ex-boyfriend. They track him down and confront him with their evidence. He denies it at first but eventually confesses to the crime. Leah is thrilled that she was able to help solve the case with her grandfather. It was a bonding experience for them both and Leah will always cherish the memories of working on the case with him.
