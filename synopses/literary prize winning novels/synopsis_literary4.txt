The story begins with the protagonist, a young woman named Lila, living in a small town in the middle of nowhere. She's in a relationship with a man named Dean, who is emotionally and physically abusive. One day, Lila decides to leave Dean and start over again somewhere new. She packs her bags and leaves town, but she doesn't get very far before her car breaks down. She's stranded in the middle of nowhere with no money and no way to get help. She starts walking, and eventually comes across a small cabin in the woods. There's no one home, but Lila decides to take shelter there for the night. The next morning, she wakes up to find a handsome stranger in the cabin with her. He tells her his name is Blaze, and that he's been watching her from the woods for some time. He's been drawn to her because she seems so lost and alone. Blaze offers to help Lila, and she accepts. He takes her back to his home in the woods, where he lives alone. Over the next few days, they begin to develop feelings for each other. Blaze tells Lila that he's been hiding from the world because he's different - he has supernatural powers. He's afraid of what would happen if people found out about him. Lila reassured Blaze that she would never judge him or try to change him. They continue to grow closer and eventually fall in love with each other. However, their happiness is short-lived when Dean shows up at Blaze's cabin one day, demanding that Lila come home with him. Dean is furious when he finds out that Lila has been with another man, and he starts to beat her. Blaze intervenes and uses his powers to fight off Dean. Dean is terrified of what he's seen and runs away into the woods. Lila is relieved that she finally stands up to Dean and walks away from him for good this time. She decides to stay with Blaze in the woods, where they live happily ever after together..
