The story begins with the Doctor meeting a young woman named Amy Pond. Amy is distressed because she has been seeing a strange man in a blue box following her around. The Doctor tells her that the man is him, but from the future. He then proceeds to take Amy on a series of adventures through time and space, showing her wonders that she never could have imagined. Along the way, they are joined by Amy's fianc√©, Rory Williams. The three of them fight Daleks, Cybermen, and other enemies of the Doctor while also encountering strange creatures and places. In the end, they defeat the main villain, a creature called the Weeping Angels, and save the day. The Doctor then returns Amy and Rory to their home in present-day England, where they live happily ever after.
