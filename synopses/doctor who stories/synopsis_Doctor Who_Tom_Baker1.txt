The story begins with the Doctor and his companion, Ace, materializing in a forest outside a small town in the US. It's night time, and they are both disoriented and confused. They stumble upon a campsite where a group of teenagers are gathered around a fire. The Doctor approaches them and asks if they know what year it is. The teens reply that it's 2019. The Doctor and Ace are shocked to realize that they've landed in the future. The teens tell the Doctor and Ace that they were just about to go on a hike to explore a nearby abandoned town. The town was abandoned years ago after a botched experiment by the government caused a explosion that killed everyone in the town. The teenagers invite the Doctor and Ace to join them on their hike. The group reaches the town and starts exploring. They soon realize that they're not alone. They're being watched by something lurking in the shadows. The creatures attack, and the group is forced to flee. They make it back to the forest, but not before the creatures snatch one of the teens. The Doctor and Ace decide to go back into town to try and rescue the missing teenager. They find the creatures' lair and discover that the creatures are actually aliens that have been stranded on Earth for years. The aliens are using the humans as food to survive. The Doctor and Ace manage to rescue the teenager and destroy the aliens' ship. As they're leaving, the Doctor finds an old book with a message from one of the aliens. The message says that there are other ships like theirs stranded on other planets across the Universe. The Doctor realizes that he has to find these other ships and stop them from feeding off of innocent people before it's too late.
