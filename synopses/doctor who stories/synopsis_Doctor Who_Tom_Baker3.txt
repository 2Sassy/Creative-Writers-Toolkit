The story begins with the Doctor and his companions, Romana and K9, receiving a transmission from an old friend, Professor Chronotis. The transmission is cut short, so the Doctor decides to investigate. When they reach Earth, they discover that Chronotis has retired from academia and is now a hermit living in a small cottage. He is surprised to see the Doctor, but invites them in. Chronotis explains that he is in possession of a powerful relic called the Time Vector Generator, which allows him to travel through time. He has been using it to visit different eras and study history, but he is growing tired of it and wants to return the Generator to its rightful owner. The Doctor agrees to take the Generator off his hands, but as they are leaving the cottage, they are attacked by a group of aliens called the Sontarans. The Sontarans want the Time Vector Generator for themselves so that they can use it to conquer the galaxy. A fierce battle ensues, during which the Doctor and his companions are able to defeat the Sontarans and retrieve the Time Vector Generator. They bid farewell to Chronotis and return to the TARDIS, ready for their next adventure.
