The story begins on a dark desert highway. The protagonist is driving towards a shimmering light in the distance. They begin to feel tired and dizzy, and eventually have to stop for the night. They walk towards the light, which turns out to be coming from a large hotel. The protagonist is greeted by a beautiful woman who invites them inside. They enter a huge room filled with people dancing and drinking. The woman leads the protagonist upstairs to their room, where they collapse into bed. During the night, the protagonist is awoken by voices coming from down the hall. They get up to investigate and find themselves in a long corridor lined with doors. Each door has a nameplate on it, but they can't read them. The protagonist tries each door, but they are all locked. Suddenly, the woman appears at the end of the corridor and beckons for the protagonist to follow her. They walk into a large chamber where a group of people are gathered around a table eating and drinking. The woman tells the protagonist that they are all prisoners here, and that they will never be able to leave. The protagonist wakes up in their room, unsure if what they experienced was real or just a dream. They decide to check out of the hotel and leave immediately. As they are driving away, they see the woman in the distance standing in the doorway of the hotel, waving goodbye.
