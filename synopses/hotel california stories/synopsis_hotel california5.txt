The story begins with the protagonist driving down a dark desert highway. They see a light in the distance and as they get closer, they see it is a hotel. They check in and are greeted by the strange Hotel California staff. The protagonist has a sense that something is off, but they ignore it. They go to their room and meet the other guests, who are all drinking and partying. The protagonist feels out of place and wanders around the hotel. They eventually find their way to the courtyard, where they see people dancing. One of the guests, a woman, sees the protagonist and beckons them over. The woman introduces herself as Tiffany and asks the protagonist to dance. The two of them dance together and Tiffany begins to tell the protagonist about the hotel. She says that it is a place where people come to forget their pasts and start anew. The protagonist is intrigued and decides to stay for awhile. Over the next few days, the protagonist begins to feel like they are being watched. They have strange dreams where people are being killed. These dreams become more and more intense until finally, the protagonist can't take it anymore. They go to check out of the hotel, but they are stopped by the night man. The night man tells them that they can never leave the hotel--they are prisoners there forever. The protagonist tries to run away, but they are caught by the other guests. They are brought back to the courtyard where they see Tiffany dancing with another man. The man stabs Tiffany with a knife and she falls to the ground dead. The protagonist realizes that this is what has been happening in their dreams and they are now stuck in this place forever.
