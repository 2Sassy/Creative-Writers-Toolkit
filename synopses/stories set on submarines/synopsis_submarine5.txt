The submarine is being transferred to a new captain, who is unknown to the crew. The new captain, Captain Jameson, is a strict and unforgiving man. He immediately sets out to assert his authority over the crew. The first mate, Lieutenant Commander Smith, is a experienced and level-headed man. He attempts to keep the peace between the captain and the crew. The submarine goes on a mission to track down a enemy submarine. They find it, but the enemy submarine is too fast and escapes. The captain orders the submarine to pursue, even though it is against protocol. The submarine chase leads them into enemy waters. They are attacked by enemy ships and torpedoes. The submarine is damaged and starts to sink. The captain orders the crew to abandon ship. The crew is rescued by enemy ships and taken prisoner. They are interrogated and tortured for information. The captain refuses to give anything away, even when threatened with death. The interrogators eventually give up and send the captain and crew to a prison camp. The crew manages to escape from the prison camp and make their way back to friendly territory. They are welcomed as heroes and given new assignments. Captain Robertson is given command of another submarine.
