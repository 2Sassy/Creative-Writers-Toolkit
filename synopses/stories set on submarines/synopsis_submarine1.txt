The story begins with the main character, John, as he is getting ready for his first day of work on a submarine. He is nervous and excited, but also a bit scared. He has never been on a submarine before. As he enters the submarine, he is greeted by the captain and the other crew members. They show him to his station and explain his duties. John is amazed by the control room and all of the buttons and switches. He watches as the captain orders the submarine to dive. Suddenly, an alarm goes off and the captain orders John to go check on the engine room. John races to the engine room, but when he gets there, he realizes that he has no idea what to do. He starts to panic as the engine room starts to fill with water. Suddenly, someone grabs him from behind and pulls him out of the room. John turns around to see that it is the captain. The captain tells John that he did a brave thing by going into the engine room and that he is now a part of the crew.
