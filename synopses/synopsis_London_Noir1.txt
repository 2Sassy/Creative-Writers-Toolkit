The story begins with our hardboiled private detective, John, hiring out to a local Londoncrime boss, Mr. Big. Mr. Big wants John to find out who has been stealing from him and to put a stop to it. John begins his investigation by tracking down one of the suspects, a man named Jake. Jake is a small-time crook who has been working for Mr. Big for years. Jake denies any involvement in the thefts, but John doesn't believe him. Next, John tries to get information from one of Mr. Big's other employees, a woman named Sarah. Sarah is reluctant to talk, but she eventually reveals that she saw Jake stealing from Mr. Big's office. With this new information, John confronts Jake again. This time, Jake doesn't deny it and he confesses to stealing from Mr. Big. However, Jake claims that he was only stealing because he was desperate and needed the money. John decides to believe Jake and he helps him get the money he needs to pay off his debts. In return, Jake agrees to stop stealing and to work for Mr. Big again. The story ends with John returning to Mr. Big's office and telling him what happened. Mr. Big is pleased with John's work and he gives him a bonus for his efforts.
