The story begins with the victim, John, being found dead in his office. The door is locked from the inside and there is no sign of forced entry. The only potential weapon is a letter opener that is laying on the floor next to the body. The police are called to the scene and begin their investigation. The first suspect is John's wife, who was having an affair with another man. However, she has an iron clad alibi. The second suspect is the man she was having an affair with, but he also has a solid alibi. With no other leads, the police are at a standstill. That is until they find out that John had been receiving mysterious letters in the weeks leading up to his death. The letters were all signed "Your Secret Admirer" and they became increasingly more threatening in nature. The police track down the person who sent the letters and arrest them for John's murder.
