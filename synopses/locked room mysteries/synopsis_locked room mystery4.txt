The story begins with the police being called to a house in the middle of the night. When they arrive, they find a woman's body in the living room. There is no sign of forced entry and all the windows and doors are locked from the inside. The only clues are a broken vase and a trail of blood leading upstairs. The police begin their investigation by interviewing the husband and children of the victim. The husband is Cooperative but seems very upset. The children are scared and don't know what happened. They all say they were asleep when it happened. The police then begin to search the house for clues. They find a bloody handprint on the upstairs banister and a broken vase in the living room. They also find a knife in the kitchen sink that has been wiped clean. The police send the handprint to be analyzed and it comes back as a match for the husband. They arrest him and charge him with murder. The husband denies any involvement in his wife's death and says he was asleep when it happened. The police don't believe him and say that he must have killed her in a fit of rage after an argument. The trial begins and evidence is presented that supports both sides of the story. The jury deliberates for days but can't reach a verdict. The judge declares a mistrial. After the trial, the police investigate further and find out that the victim's children were actually awake when she was killed. They had heard footsteps coming up the stairs and someone entering their mother's bedroom but they were too scared to tell anyone. The police now believe that the husband is innocent and that one of the children must have killed their mother. But they can't figure out which one did it or why they did it. END SYNOPSIS
