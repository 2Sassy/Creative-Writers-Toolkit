The story begins with a bright, shining light. This light is a source of warmth and comfort for the protagonist. However, this light is also a source of danger. The protagonist knows this, and yet they can't help but be drawn to it. The light represents the Sun, and the protagonist is a Solar Flare. The Sun is incredibly hot, and solar flares are attracted to it. But solar flares only have a short lifespan, and they burn out quickly. The protagonist knows this, but they can't help but be drawn to the Sun's warmth and light. Eventually, the protagonist gets too close to the Sun and they burn out. But before they do, they create one final, massive burst of light and heat. This burst is so bright and so hot that it incinerates anything in its path. After the protagonist burns out, there is nothing left but darkness. The world is left cold and dark without the Sun's warmth. But eventually, another Solar Flare will be born, and the cycle will begin again.
