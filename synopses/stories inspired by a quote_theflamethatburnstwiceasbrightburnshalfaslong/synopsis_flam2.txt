The story begins with a bright, shining star -- a supernova who burns twice as bright and twice as hot as any other star in the sky. This star is so bright that it casts a shadow over the entire universe. The other stars in the sky are jealous of this star's light, and they plot to extinguish its light. One night, while the supernova is sleeping, the other stars sneak up on it and shove it out of the sky. The supernova falls to earth and crash lands in a small town in the middle of nowhere. The supernova is broken and battered from its fall, but it is still alive. It meets a young girl who has never seen a star before, and she helps nurse it back to health. The two of them become fast friends, and the supernova shares its light with the girl. Gradually, however, the supernova starts to fade. Its light grows dimmer and dimmer until finally it goes out completely. The girl is heartbroken, but she knows that even though the supernova's life was shorter than other stars, it burned twice as bright while it lasted.
