The story begins with Damien Drake, a British trucker from a poor community in Northern England, arriving in a small town in the middle of nowhere. He's been driving for days and he's exhausted. All he wants to do is find a place to stay for the night so he can get some sleep. The only place he can find is a seedy motel called the White Sands. 

He gets a room and tries to get some sleep, but he's quickly awoken by screams coming from the room next door. He goes to investigate and finds a woman being attacked by a man. Damien instinctively steps in to help her, and he ends up beating up the attacker. 

The woman, whose name is Sarah, is bruised and shaken but otherwise unharmed. She tells Damien that her husband had been abusing her for years and she was trying to leave him. She was on her way to stay with her sister when her car broke down and she ended up at the White Sands. 

Damien offers to drive her to her sister's house. On the way there, they stop at a roadside diner for dinner. While they're there, Sarah's husband, Richard, shows up. He's angry and drunk and he starts making a scene. Damien tries to defuse the situation, but Richard pulls out a knife and threatens Sarah. Damien grabs him and puts him in a chokehold until he passes out. 

When they get to Sarah's sister's house, Sarah wants him to stay the night with her.  But Damien knows he can't commit to what she needs.  He says goodbye and drives away.
