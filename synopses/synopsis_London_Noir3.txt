The story begins with our protagonist, John, waking up in a cold sweat. He's had the same dream for weeks now - a faceless man stabbing him over and over. After shaking off the dream, John tries to start his day like normal. He's a PI, and he's been hired by a beautiful woman, Elizabeth, to find her missing husband, David. Elizabeth is desperate to find her husband, and she's willing to pay John whatever it takes. So he begins his investigation, starting with David's last known whereabouts. He talks to David's friends, colleagues, and anyone else who might have seen him before he disappeared. But no one seems to know anything. As John gets deeper into the case, he realizes that everyone he talks to is lying to him. They're all hiding something. And the more people he talks to, the more danger he seems to be in. Finally, he confronts Elizabeth with what he has learned - that her husband was involved in some very shady business deals. She breaks down and tells him the whole story. It turns out that David was mixed up with a group of criminals who were involved in drug trafficking and human trafficking. He was in way over his head, and they threatened to kill him if he didn't do what they said. So he ran away, hoping to start a new life with Elizabeth. But the criminal group found out about his plans and kidnapped him before he could leave the country. John knows that if he can find David, he can also find the people who took him. So he sets out to track down the criminals and rescue David before it's too late. The story comes to a climax as John infiltrates their hideout and faces off against the criminals. In the end, he rescue Elizabeth's husband and brings the criminals to justice.
