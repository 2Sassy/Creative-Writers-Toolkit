The story begins with Damien Drake, a British trucker from a small town in Northern England, hauling goods across the country. He's been on the road for years, and he's developed a strong sense of right and wrong. When he see someone being bullied or taken advantage of, he can't help but step in - even if it means getting into a fight or two. That sense of justice has gotten him into more than one scrap over the years, but it's also one of the things that makes him who he is. One day, while Damien is stopped at a truck stop outside of London, he witnesses a young woman being abducted by a group of men. He knows he can't just stand by and do nothing, so he intervenes. He manages to rescue the woman and get her to safety, but not before getting himself severely beaten in the process. The young woman, whose name is Sarah, is extremely grateful to Damien for saving her. She tells him that she was on her way to meet her sister when she was abducted, and she asks him to take her there. Damien agrees, and the two of them set off on the long journey north. As they travel together, Damien and Sarah begin to develop feelings for each other. But before they can act on those feelings, they find themselves in the middle of a criminal conspiracy that goes all the way to the top of the British government. They quickly realize that they're in way over their heads - but they're also determined to see it through to the end. With enemies on all sides, Damien and Sarah have to use all their wits and courage to survive as they race against time to uncover the truth. Along the way, they discover that they have more in common than they could have ever imagined - and that their enemies are far more dangerous than they could have ever imagined. The story culminates with a final showdown between Damien and Sarah against those who would conspire against them. In the end, justice is served - but at what cost?
