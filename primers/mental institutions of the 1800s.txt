The large gothic buildings of asylums resembled penitentiaries in more ways than one. The windows were barred, the grounds fenced in, and the bedrooms were locked. A diagnosis of insanity said that you were not fit to take care of yourself, and thus you became a ward of the state, often whether you wanted to or not. And once you were in, it could be nearly impossible to convince the staff that you were sane.

One woman ended up there after her health gave way and her nephew ran out of funds. Other women simply didn't speak enough English to make themselves understood. Bly herself was unable to convince the doctors of her own sanity. It was only after her friends came to take her that she was able to secure release. She described the asylum as "a human rat-trap."

Dr. Benjamin Rush pioneered spinning chair treatment in the 19th century. The patient would be restrained in a chair that hung from the ceiling and then twirled around in that chair around for hours at a time. It was believed that this would reduce blood flow to the brain, relax the muscles, and lower the pulse.

The inevitable vomiting that would be induced was considered a good thing, marking toxins leaving the body.

Keeping a massive population of powerless, mentally ill people in isolated institutions at the mercy of the staff is a recipe for abuse. Unruly patients were often beaten, restrained, and isolated.

As Nellie Bly noted, nurses would often beat patients on a whim. Patients were strangled, had their hair ripped out, and even had their heads held underwater. Staff members would tease and agitate patients on purpose. Complaining of conditions to the doctors and supervisors was one way to instigate the abuse, and the doctors generally wouldn't listen anyway.
